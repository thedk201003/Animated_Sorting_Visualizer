# Sorting Visualizer

## Description
**Sorting Visualizer** is a web-based application built using **React.js** that helps visualize various sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more. It allows users to understand how these algorithms work through animated graphical representations. The project aims to provide a fun and interactive way for users, especially students, to grasp sorting concepts.

## Demo
Live Demo Link: https://animated-sorting-visualizer-ch28.vercel.app/

## Features
- Visualizes multiple sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, etc.
- Responsive design for different screen sizes.
- Step-by-step animations showing the sorting process.
- Adjustable array size and speed of sorting.
- Option to choose different algorithms for comparison.

## Tech Stack
- **Front-end**: React.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Tools & Libraries**:
  - React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
  - Custom hooks for sorting logic
  - CSS for styling and animations
  - JavaScript for implementing the sorting algorithms

How to Run Locally
Prerequisites
Node.js installed (version 14.x or higher)
npm or yarn package manager
Steps to Clone and Run the Project
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code

Navigate into the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd sorting-visualizer
Install dependencies:
If you're using npm:
bash
Copy code
npm install
If you're using yarn:
bash

Build for Production
To create a production-ready build, run:

bash
Copy code
npm run build
This will create an optimized production build in the build folder.

Screenshots
Add screenshots or GIFs of your Sorting Visualizer here to show how it works.

Future Enhancements
Add more sorting algorithms (e.g., Heap Sort, Radix Sort).
Allow users to pause and resume the sorting process.
Provide explanations of how each algorithm works during the visualization.
